# Google_Dinosour
 Computer games are mostly used for entertainment purposes.
Currently, many consumer game machines are based on the operations
of processors. However, in the field programmable gate array (FPGA)
research field, various FPGA game solvers have been developed
recently. The processing speeds of such FPGA game solvers can reach
about 1000 times faster than processor-based operations. And Field
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology is becoming more popular
among Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) developers. The
ease of development and maintainability makes FPGAs an attractive
option in many performance and efficiency in critical applications. So in
this project we have designed an offline Google Dinosaur Game based
on FPGA using Verilog HDL. Game players can move and control blocks
with the USB interface keyboard . Game video is shown on a VGA monitor. Here the Real work behind this gaming project is to interface
VGA monitor or projector, keyboard, interface with FPGA and control
them through programming. The successful transplant of these games
provides a template for the development of other visual systems in the
FPGA. Here everything is implemented in hardware on FPGA.And we used bit mapping and object mapping to map dinosour,obstacle,clouds and score board.
